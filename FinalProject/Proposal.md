# Overview
My final project will be a rendered simulation of traveling through space which I aim to be somewhere in between [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILpSTIy6Fw) put together with [this](http://www.dilladimension.com/).
I plan on having planets, if not solar systems, that are fully textured to zoom by the main view.
My stretch goal is to have a dynamic camera in the scene so as to simulate turning and to display solar systems rathen than lone planets.

## Week to week tasks
1. Collect necessary information about THREE.js and gather assets for planets 
2. Have code to generate planets and texture map it
3. Have procedural placement of planets done
4. Have movement of planets in a direction done
5. (Stretch) deal with rotation of camera view and try to replace individual planets with solar systems.

### Implementation
I plan on using THREE.js to create a web-based application.
